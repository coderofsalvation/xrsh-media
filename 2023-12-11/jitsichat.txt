Update: can we postpone the friday-call to monday? It turned my wife's
sister has her wedding (and I completely forgot while talking to you)

> Clearly though, between the vocabulary and complexity it, sadly iMHO,
didn't "blow up". It's quite abstract yet I believe they are the only true
"metaverse" implementation.

The direction is indeed cool.
I guess Activitypub is nice for slow realtime comms (which is often good
enough), I guess they used NAF for spatial syncing.
Matrix protocol seems to allow for all of that in one (thirdroom e.g.)
which is pretty impressive.
I guess in both cases (human) bandwidth is hard to push these things
forward.
Sortof the reason why I kept the scope of 
https://xrfragments.org
 very
small.

I've added one thing to the agenda:

next meeting:
- how do we communicate efficiently with a trace
- selfhosted repo (forgejo/gitea e.g.) + GH/GL locked mirror-repo's?
- how meta do we want to go and use xrsh itself to collaborate
- accessibility services/lab NLnet
- shelltype-dropdown in XR terminal

Why? In order for it to be useful for various kinds of people/accessibility.
How? include a dropdown to switch between "linux", "huggingface/GPT4ALL",
"MUSH" e.g.
Especially the MUSH-example might be THE textual escape-hatch for people
with screenreaders to access XR.
Jens (of Interpeer) mentioned to me that these MUD's already solved so much
accessibility issues.
I totally forgot about that...but they are also a SHELL.
Perhaps you can read this article before next meeting:
